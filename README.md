# SnapchatClone
Description:
     As the name claims itself, it is a Snapchat clone. Sign up/in, take a picture, and send it to the other users that have logged in previously.

iOS compatibility: versions 7-10

xCode: version 8.3.3

Language: Swift 3


Functionality:

      * The app uses Firebase for:
           -the log in/sign in service offered to the users;
           -the database that stores details regarding the snaps that each user has received
           -the Storage that keeps the pictures of the snaps.        
      * Access to camera / photo library using the default way.
      * Default-plain style UIAllert, that informs the user when the snap has been sent to the other user.
      * Nice way to communicate the status of the proccess (the uploading time is sugested by a label, and there is an allert that pops out after the snap has been sent).
